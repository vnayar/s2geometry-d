			<h1>Class S2Builder</h1><p>S2Builder is a tool for assembling polygonal geometry from edges.  Here are
 some of the things it is designed for:

			<section><p>1. Building polygons, polylines, and polygon meshes from unsorted
    collections of edges.
</p>

<p> 2. Snapping geometry to discrete representations (such as S2CellId centers
    or E7 lat/lng coordinates) while preserving the input topology and with
    guaranteed error bounds.
</p>

<p> 3. Simplifying geometry (e.g. for indexing, display, or storage).
</p>

<p> 4. Importing geometry from other formats, including repairing geometry
    that has errors.
</p>

<p> 5. As a tool for implementing more complex operations such as polygon
    intersections and unions.
</p>

<p> The implementation is based on the framework of "snap rounding".  Unlike
 most snap rounding implementations, S2Builder defines edges as geodesics on
 the sphere (straight lines) and uses the topology of the sphere (i.e.,
 there are no "seams" at the poles or 180th meridian).  The algorithm is
 designed to be 100% robust for arbitrary input geometry.  It offers the
 following properties:
</p>

<p>   - Guaranteed bounds on how far input vertices and edges can move during
     the snapping process (i.e., at most the given "snap_radius").
</p>

<p>   - Guaranteed minimum separation between edges and vertices other than
     their endpoints (similar to the goals of Iterated Snap Rounding).  In
     other words, edges that do not intersect in the output are guaranteed
     to have a minimum separation between them.
</p>

<p>   - Idempotency (similar to the goals of Stable Snap Rounding), i.e. if the
     input already meets the output criteria then it will not be modified.
</p>

<p>   - Preservation of the input topology (up to the creation of
     degeneracies).  This means that there exists a continuous deformation
     from the input to the output such that no vertex crosses an edge.  In
     other words, self-intersections won't be created, loops won't change
     orientation, etc.
</p>

<p>   - The ability to snap to arbitrary discrete point sets (such as S2CellId
     centers, E7 lat/lng points on the sphere, or simply a subset of the
     input vertices), rather than being limited to an integer grid.
</p>

<p> Here are some of its other features:
</p>

<p>  - It can handle both directed and undirected edges.  Undirected edges can
    be useful for importing data from other formats, e.g. where loops have
    unspecified orientations.
</p>

<p>  - It can eliminate self-intersections by finding all edge pairs that cross
    and adding a new vertex at each intersection point.
</p>

<p>  - It can simplify polygons to within a specified tolerance.  For example,
    if two vertices are close enough they will be merged, and if an edge
    passes nearby a vertex then it will be rerouted through that vertex.
    Optionally, it can also detect nearly straight chains of short edges and
    replace them with a single long edge, while maintaining the same
    accuracy, separation, and topology guarantees ("simplify_edge_chains").
</p>

<p>  - It supports many different output types through the concept of "layers"
    (polylines, polygons, polygon meshes, etc).  You can build multiple
    layers at once in order to ensure that snapping does not create
    intersections between different objects (for example, you can simplify a
    set of contour lines without the risk of having them cross each other).
</p>

<p>  - It supports edge labels, which allow you to attach arbitrary information
    to edges and have it preserved during the snapping process.  (This can
    also be achieved using layers, at a coarser level of granularity.)

 in spherical geometry that does not exist in planar geometry.  Namely, if
 a polygon has no edges, does it represent the empty polygon (containing
 no points) or the full polygon (containing all points)?  This ambiguity
 also occurs for polygons that consist only of degeneracies, e.g. a
 degenerate loop with only two edges could be either a degenerate shell in
 the empty polygon or a degenerate hole in the full polygon.

 When used with an appropriate layer type, you can then retrieve the
 labels associated with each output edge.  This can be useful when merging
 or combining data from several sources.  (Note that in many cases it is
 easier to use separate output layers rather than labels.)

			<section><h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>- Because S2Builder only works with edges, it cannot distinguish between
    the empty and full polygons.  If your application can generate both the
    empty and full polygons, you must implement logic outside of this class.
